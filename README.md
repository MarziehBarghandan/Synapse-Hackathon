# Synapse Hackathon

## Exercise 0: Env setup (D1 30 min) + whiteboarding
Portal or ARM deploy

## Exercise 1: [Load data](<./Exercise 1.md>)  (D1 1H)
At this exercise you should connect to different data sources that WWI needs to collect data and create a pipeline to move data into a centralized data lake. No transformation over data is required. The solution should cover delta load for big tables.

## Exercise 2: [Transformation](./Exercise 2.md) (Raw to CDM) (D1 4H)
 
  - Basic data quiality check (null value, strings, special charecters, bad data types) 
  - Database templates (.parquet)
     - Mapping tool
     - Transformation (build by mapping tool) 
     - Data Flows / pipelines (automated)
 
  
## Exercise 3: Datawarehouse (D2 3H)
   Star schema transformation:
   <ul> 
    <li> Data flows
    <li> Spark Pools
    </ul>
    Save data as Delta files
    
## Exercise 4: Reporting (Mark-Marijn) (D2 1H)
  PowerBI integration with Synapse
  Push data marts to PowerBI
  
## Good to have Exercises:
### Exercise 5: Machine Learning (share a ONNX model to play with)
### Exercise 6: Purview
### Exercise 7: Data Mesh
