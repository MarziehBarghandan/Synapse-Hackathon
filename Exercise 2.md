# Transform raw data
During this exercise we would like to implement data quilty check and transform raw data into a industry schema.
- Check tables for 
   - null values
   - Summary, Average, Standard Deviation, Percentiles for Numeric Columns
   - Distinct Count
   - Distribution Count
   - Data Quality (regex pattern) \
Here is an example for "Sales.Orders" Table. [Sales.Orders Data Checks](<./SalesOrders-DQ-Check.ipynb>)  
This example is based on: (<https://github.com/akashmehta10/profiling_pyspark>)
